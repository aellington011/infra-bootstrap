# Infrastructure Bootstrap Template
A near complete and basic deployable environment for running a web application. This includes all software and services to create, deploy, run, monitor, and otherwise maintain a web application. The goal is to spin up a new environment in AWS quickly using best practices & secure configurations as a starting place for cloud service.

**Note:** This runs in AWS and will incure a bill for deploying and/or active testing even with just running the sample web app!
